  title : "Created from a need to unite QC Calculations"
  content : "<q><i>I'd like to do machine learning on dataset X from a single line.</q></i><br><br>
  <q><i>I want to generate bespoke parameters for a new drug from an existing database.</q></i><br><br>
  <q><i>Which DFT method gives the best results for my set of reactions?</q></i><br><br>

  These are some of the use cases we at MolSSI heard from the QC community when evaluating
  how best to serve this area. The emerging trend we saw was a need to have regular structure of QC results, the ability to access them on-demand without
  downloading several GB of data, and run new calculations if need be ideally without repeating what someone has already done. To meet these goals, the QCArchive
  project was started to unite this otherwise isolated data which may only have been shared previously though massive, non-regular files; or though publications and
  supplementary material. Funded by the NSF, MolSSI seeks to provide solutions to these, and other use-cases in the Quantum Chemistry field through the
  QCArchive project

  title : "The QCArchive is an Open-Source Ecosystem"
  content : "The QCA project is designed from the start to be open-source and available to everyone. All of the code
  is public through various GitHub repositories, and we are contributing back to other Open Source projects as good
  members of the community. Individual pieces are written to be integrated into other components (e.g. QCElemental), and
  we integrate as many other projects as we can to handle tasks to avoid duplicating (often ineffectively) existing
  software."

    content : "QCArchive's projects are all based on the same software best practices. Both users and developers can
    follow the code structure between all of the projects, and these practices are provided back to the community
    through the external projects like the CMS-Cookiecutter."

    title : "Code quality is of utmost importance"
    content : "The quality of the QCArchive code is checked through rigorous continuous integration, code linters, and test coverage
    tools which help reduce the chance that bugs are introduced. We take data accuracy very seriously and all results
    and calculations are versioned, provenance tracked, and will be preserved over any updates of the database. "

    title: "Proprietary data? Not a problem."
    content: "We understand that some users and companies have proprietary data. QCArchive's main database and job
    distribution engine, QCFractal, can be created locally on your hardware and connected to your compute cluster
    without ever communicating outside your firewall. There is a feature we are designing which will allow one-way
    communication with our persistent server so you can reference the existing database without exposing your own
    information."
