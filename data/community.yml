      name : "Open Force Field Consortium"
      designation : "Collaborator and Sponsor"
      content : "The <a href='https://openforcefield.org'>OpenFF Consortium</a>
is an academic-industry collaboration designed to improve computer models used
to guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. They are a major sponsor of the
QCArchive and the partner for the use case of generating data for the
parameters of a bespoke force field. They fragment and provide inputs for
torsion scans, then provide those inputs to the QCArchive ecosystem for
computation. Those computations then help generate parameters for the force
fields based on atomic elements and connectivity rather than atom typing."

    # Distributed Driver

      name: "Quantum Chemistry Distributed Driver"
      designation: "Developer and Extension"
      content: "The Distributed Driver is a Psi4 compute driver designed to
deconvolute staged driver operations which depend on one another while also
separating the quantum chemistry compute implementations from the higher level
theory and procedures. Multiple calculation managers and any subsequent
managers which are dependent can be staged together such that compute commands
issued at parents are propagated to the children.

                <br></br>

                This sort of distribution and job staging is exactly what the
QCFractal job queue and distributed managers were designed to handle. QCEngine's
schema-based input enables the type of programmatic execution needed to handle
these computations. Fractal, Engine, and Schema together vastly reduce the
barrier to efficiently setup and implement this technology and the Distributed
Driver handles the top level task creation logic and post-compute processing."

      designation: "Collaborator"
      content: "The QUantum mechanical BEspoke toolkit (QUBEKit) is a software
package developed at Newcastle University, UK. QUBEKit automates the derivation
of bespoke bond, angle, dihedral and non-bonded force field parameters for
small organic molecules directly from quantum chemistry calculations, which are
reliably provided through the QCEngine. QUBEKit will make use of
QCArchive/Fractal to rapidly fit torsion parameters of unique molecules, to
provide an intuitive interface for accurate and bespoke force field design.
