      content : "The <a href='https://openforcefield.org'>OpenFF Consortium</a> is an academic-industry collaboration
                 designed to improve computer models used to
                 guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. They are a major sponsor of the QCArchive and the partner for the use case of
                 generating data for the parameters of a bespoke force field. They fragment and provide inputs for
                 torsion scans, then provide those inputs to the QCArchive ecosystem for computation. Those computations
                 then help generate parameters for the force fields based on atomic elements and connectivity rather
                 than atom typing."

    # Distributed Driver
    # From Lori: seamless embarrassingly parallel capabilities, deconvolute driver code, separate generic QC procedures driver from QC methods backend, checkpointing

      name: "Distributed Driver"
      designation: "Developer and Extension"
      content: "The Distributed Driver is a Psi4 compute driver designed to deconvolute staged driver operations which
                depend on one another while also separating the quantum chemistry compute implementations from the
                higher level theory and procedures. Multiple calculation managers and any subsequent managers
                which are dependent can be staged together such that compute commands issued at parents are propagated
                to the children.
                This sort of distribution and job staging is exactly what the Fractal job queue and distributed
                managers were designed to handle. Engine's schema-based input enables the type of programmatic execution
                needed to handle these computations. Fractal, Engine, and Schema together vastly reduce the barrier to
                efficiently setup and implement this technology and the Distributed Driver handles the top level task
                creation logic and post-compute processing."
