      The MolSSI QCArchive offers <a href='https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/'>FAIR</a> access to millions of computational molecular science results.
      These include curated interaction energy, thermochemical, and conformational datasets from the literature;
      data from the <a href='https://openforcefield.org/'>OpenFF</a> initiative; and data donated to or computed by MolSSI.
      You are also welcome to submit your own data.

    content: "The QCArchive software infrastructure was created not as a monolithic piece of
software, but as several modules that form an ecosystem.  This provides many
libraries that can be used independently. Whether you want physical constants
and molecule parsing with QCElemental, a quantum chemistry program agnostic
executor with QCEngine, or to run your own QCFractal database and/or compute workflow, 
all software is open to the community.

  The community can extend the MolSSI QCArchive database by
  supplying compute time or data. If you are interested
  in additional methods for a given dataset get in touch! Also, if you have a
  well-structured dataset that is not within our database already, we accept
  contributions. This process is currently in beta, and we are actively looking
  to work with additional groups.
