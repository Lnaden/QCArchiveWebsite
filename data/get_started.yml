  QCArchive provides a complete platform for computing, managing, and organizing large-scale quantum chemical workflows and datasets.
  This platform is already used by the OpenFF project, and we are actively looking
  to work with additional groups.

  QCArchive welcomes data contributions and suggestions from the community.
  If you have a well-structured dataset that is not yet within the QCArchive,
  please reach out.
  If you are interested in additional methods for an existing dataset,
  or would like to suggest that we add a dataset,
  get in touch!

    title: "Use the QCArchive infrastructure in your projects"
    content: "
QCArchive is powered by an open-source software infrastructure.
This infrastructure was created not as a monolithic piece of
software, but as several modules that form an ecosystem of independent libraries.
Whether you want physical constants and molecule parsing with QCElemental, a quantum chemistry program agnostic
executor with QCEngine, or to run your own QCFractal database and/or compute workflow,
all software is open to the community.

    title : "Paid support"
    content : "
The QCArchive infrastructure is an open-source project backed by the
Molecular Sciences Software Institute.
In addition to our open-source commitments, paid support for custom QCFractal instances, code, consulting, and
priority support is available.
For academic projects, consider writing us into your next grant for priority support and training.
Contact us for additional information.
